## Hi there 👋

I'm a frontend developer from Warsaw, Poland focusing on React and Next.js.

I've recently completed a UI software engineering internship, and I'm looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with other human beings.

### What I bring to the team

- 👀 an eye for design + attention to detail (I *do* count pixels 😅)

- 💬 good communication skills + proficiency in English

- 🔧 a can-do attitude + enthusiasm for learning new things

### What I find important

- 🦾 accessibility: why build web apps if people can't use them?

- 👌 simplicity: let's not make lives (or codebase) any harder

- 🧠 teamwork: mutual brain-picking = faster and better solutions to problems

## 🎨 Tools and languages

What I've used so far:
